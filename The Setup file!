Step 1. The qcow images for NDN and IP can be obtained by:

    wget 'http:/http://emmy10.casa.umass.edu/CNP/ipVM.qcow2' - IP VM image
    wget 'http:/http://emmy10.casa.umass.edu/CNP/ndnVM.qcow2' - NDN VM image

Step 2. Configuring the VM's 

    2.a Install Virsh on the base machine. 

    2.b To start virsh:
        - sudo /etc/init.d/
        - sudo apt-get install libvirt-bin
        - sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-bin ubuntu-vm-builder bridge-utils
        - virsh connect qemu:///system
        - virsh list

    2.c After which, create the ipVM and ndnVM XML files

        - cd /tmp
        - virsh dumpxml ndnVM > ndnVM.xml

        - cd /tmp
        - virsh dumpxml ipVM > ipVM.xml

    2.d To manager the virtualization better, use virt-manager GUI.

        - Install virt-mamager:
        - sudo apt-get install virt-manager
        - To run: sudo virt-manager

        2.d.1 To start the virt-manager GUI - Have xauth and xterm installed on the server:
            - sudo apt-get install xauth
            - sudo apt-get install xterm

        2.d.2 Have XMing running on the windows (client) machine :Download and run Xming


        Note: *Run Putty with X11 forwarding (on client, connecting to server)
              *On the routers run – cp /users/<yourusername>/.Xauthority /root/”
              * Start virt-manager after running Xming server
      
      2.e To use virt-manager to create the bridge
      
        2.e.1 Create the bridge first on the host 
            - brctl virbr0 
            - brctl show 
        2.e.2  On the GUI, 
            - go to edit > Connection details > Network Interfaces > 'add sign' > select 'bridge' > Name 'virbr0' > Finish
        2.e.3  For the VM you want this bridge to be a part of:
            - Select ipVM > 'open' > 'Details' > Hardware ( NIC ) specify shared device name as the bridge name 
            - go back to edit > Connection details > Network Interfaces > Under Slave interface you should see a new virtual interface(vnet*) present.
        *Note: On the host to see the bridge - ifconfig virbr0 up
